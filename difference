CGI vs Servlets
CGI (Common Gateway Interface):
1. Each request spawns a new process.
2. Slower performance due to heavy resource use.
3. Language-independent (can use Python, Perl, etc.).

Servlets:
1.Runs inside servlet container (like Tomcat).
2. Single instance handles multiple requests using threads.
3.Faster, more efficient, and Java-based.
